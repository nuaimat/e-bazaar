This is the startup project for student teams, given July, 2016. The
data access subsystem uses PreparedStatements
for SQL queries of all kinds. Cache is now accessible
only in presentation layer. ShoppingCartSubsystem
is stored in cache till customer logs in. These features
make it possible to plug in a web interface seamlessly

Known issues:

1. Most windows are created new each time they are viewed
(except for CatalogListWindow).
This is probably wasteful. A better way is to initialize
all customer windows at startup (and all  admin windows when
admin logs in). This will require modification of window title 
in some cases (like ProductListWindow) depending on
user selection.
